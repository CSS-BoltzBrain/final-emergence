Download of the data is optional if you are not interested in reproducing the result of Skinner et. al. to validate the implementation.

# Data
The real world data provided by Skinner et. al. to reproduce their paper can be downloaded from their website. We do not attach and commit them in our repository due to the copyright. Here is [the link](https://motion.cs.umn.edu/PowerLaw/dl/data.zip), and you can also browser [their website](https://motion.cs.umn.edu) to have a more comprehensive view.

We reproduce the paper by checking the "outdoor" data with our "torus" simulation.
It is optional to download their data if you do not want to reproduce the simulation based on their data, which we use it simply for validation. See "Reproduce the Simulation" section below for more details.

Please check in the description of [model-universal-power-law/README.md][../README.md] for more details.
