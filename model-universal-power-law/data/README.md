Download of the data is optional if you are not interested in reproducing the result of Skinner et. al. to validate the implementation.

# Data
- **data-KSG**: real world data. See the details below.
- **data-presentation**: validate of the paper and our simulation implementation (internal Energy - time-to-collide power law)
- **data-corridor**: apply the dynamics to corridor criticality scenarios for searching for cluster distribution and jam duration power law.

The real world data provided by Skinner et. al. to reproduce their paper can be downloaded from their website. Here is [the link](https://motion.cs.umn.edu/PowerLaw/dl/data.zip), and you can also browser [their website](https://motion.cs.umn.edu) to have a more comprehensive view.

We reproduce the paper by checking the "outdoor" data with our "torus" simulation.
It is optional to download their data if you do not want to reproduce the simulation based on their data, which we use it simply for validation. See "Reproduce the Simulation" section below for more details.

Please check in the description of [model-universal-power-law/README.md][../README.md] for more details.
